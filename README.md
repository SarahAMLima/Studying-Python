In Studying-Python I aim to share with you all what I have been studying or have studied so far. 
I am an Oceanographer and I specialize in Environmental Resources Management so most of my studies are related to this field.
As I progress in Python I have been learning how Machine Learning can be applied to study our oceans, and I am hoping to bring some interesting topics on the subject soon.

------------Contaminated Areas in Brazil---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But for now, I present you a simple script to study the contaminated areas in Brazil, my home country: areas-contaminadas.ipynb. Created on Google Colab.  
I start the script with something light, a simple bar plot and I progress to some simple interactive maps. For those who simply want to have some first impressions of their data, this can be helpful. 
The idea is to see how many areas are affected by different contaminants. 
This script is part of a training I did with the online school, Ambiental Pro. The data I share here are for public use so be my guest to use it to either replicate the script or improve it.

I am a bit more advanced but as a working person, I only have a limited time during the day to revise the scripts and share them on GitHub, but, stay with me and plenty of far more interesting analyses will come.
I will be updating this readme file with a brief description of each project you may find here, in order of upload. I am not a fan of giant, sometimes unnecessary, readme files so I won't be writing a lot of them. 
But I tend to add comments in every single line of my code, so, it should be easy to follow through. The comments are mostly in Portuguese as unfortunately, there aren't many of us writing for Portuguese speakers, and I want to prioritize my fellow Brazilians who were not as fortunate as I was to afford learning English.  Sorry.  

Have fun coding!
