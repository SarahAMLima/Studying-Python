In this first repository I aim to share with you all what I have been studying or have studied. 
I am an Oceanographer and I specialize in Environmental Resources Management so most of my studies are related to this field.
As I progress in Python I have been learning how Machine Learning can be applied to study our oceans and I am hoping to bring some interesting topics on the subject soon
But for now, I present you a simple script done to study the contaminated areas in Brazil, my home country. 

I start the script with something light, a simple bar plot and I progress to some simple interactive maps. 
The idea is to see how many areas are affected by different contaminants. 

This script part of a training I did with the online school Ambiental Pro. But the data are for public use so, be my guest to use it to replicate or even improve it. 

I am a bit more advanced but as a working person I only have a limited time to revise the scripts and share them on GitHub, but stay with me and plenty of far more interesting analysis will come. 

Have fun coding!
